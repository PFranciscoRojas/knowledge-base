# Basic example

Why are we doing this?

This is necessary because we need to

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on teaching people React
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing React applications (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing C9 developers adopt it? Is
this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod? Should we coordinate with
other projects or libraries?

# How we teach this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented? As a continuation of existing C9 projects patterns?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the C9 documentation must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how C9 is taught to new developers
at any level?

How should this feature be taught to existing C9 developers?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
